  The Pakistani rupee, the official currency of Pakistan, has a rich history. Here's a brief overview:

The Pakistani rupee was introduced on August 1, 1947, following Pakistan's independence from British rule. Initially, it was on par with the Indian rupee, but the two currencies separated that same year.

In 1961, Pakistan decimalized its currency, dividing the rupee into 100 paise. However, in 1985, the use of paise was discontinued, and the rupee is now divided into smaller units called paisa.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the exchange rate of the Pakistani rupee remained relatively fixed against the US dollar, hovering around 4.76 rupees per dollar.

In the early 1970s, Pakistan adopted a floating exchange rate system, allowing the value of the rupee to be determined by market forces. This resulted in fluctuations in the exchange rate over time.

The Pakistani rupee has experienced significant devaluations against major currencies. Factors such as economic challenges, political instability, and balance of payment issues have contributed to these devaluations. Notable devaluations occurred in 1972, 1998, and 2008, leading to a decrease in the value of the rupee against the US dollar.

To stabilize the exchange rate, the State Bank of Pakistan has implemented a managed float system in recent years. Under this system, the central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to manage the value of the rupee against major currencies.

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the Pakistani rupee is still considered relatively weak compared to major international currencies. Its value fluctuates due to economic and geopolitical factors.

Please note that currency values are subject to change, and it is essential to refer to financial news and official sources for the most up-to-date information on the history and value of the Pakistani rupee.
