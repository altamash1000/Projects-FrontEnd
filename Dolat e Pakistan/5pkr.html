<h1>About:</h1><br>
<p>
  Year 2001 was added in Krause 2018 under KM#65 with note: "Not officially issued"; however, it's a pattern coin that has slightly different design and weight, and should have a different KM# (currently listed separately on Numista).
  A possibility of a normal coin (KM#65) 2001 that exists, but that's not proven yet.</p>
