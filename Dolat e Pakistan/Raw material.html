            Banknotes, also known as cash, and coins are produced using different raw materials. Banknotes primarily consist of banknote paper made from cotton or a blend of cotton and other fibers. This material is chosen for its durability, strength, and resistance to wear and tear. In some cases, polymer substrates made from specialized polymer films are also used for banknotes. The paper or polymer substrates undergo various treatments to ensure their suitability for banknote production.

            The production of banknotes incorporates the use of security inks, which are specially formulated inks that possess unique properties. These inks include features such as color-changing or fluorescent properties, which help incorporate security elements into the banknotes. The security inks play a crucial role in deterring counterfeiting by making it more difficult to replicate the appearance of genuine banknotes.
            
            Banknotes may also contain embedded security threads, which are narrow strips made of polyester or metallic materials. These threads are either visible or embedded within the banknote and often possess security properties like color-changing or light-reflecting features. The inclusion of security threads adds an additional layer of security to the banknotes and makes them more difficult to counterfeit.
            
            Watermarks are another security feature found in banknotes. Translucent materials, such as fibers or strips, are embedded into the banknote paper during production. Watermarks become visible when the banknote is held up to light, and they provide an additional security feature that is difficult to replicate.
            
            On the other hand, coins are typically made from metal alloys chosen for their durability, weight, and resistance to wear. Common metals used for coin production include copper, nickel, zinc, and brass. The specific composition of the metal alloy varies depending on the denomination and the requirements set by the issuing authority.
            
            To produce coins, metal strips or blanks are cut into round discs called planchets. These planchets are shaped into the desired size and thickness for each denomination of the coin. Engravings and designs, depicting national emblems, historical figures, or artistic elements, are then stamped onto the surface of the coin through specialized minting processes.
            
            In summary, banknotes are primarily made of banknote paper or polymer substrates, utilizing security inks, embedded security threads, and watermarks. Coins, on the other hand, are crafted from metal alloys and feature engravings and designs on their surfaces. The choice of raw materials and production processes for banknotes and coins depend on factors such as durability, security, and the specifications of the issuing authority.

                <h2>Cotton:</h2>
                <p>Pakistan is known for its significant cotton production, and cotton fibers serve as the primary raw material for banknote paper production. The cotton used for banknotes is typically of high quality and selected for its durability and strength. It undergoes various processes to transform it into banknote paper, including cleaning, bleaching, and refining.</p>

                <h2>Security Inks: </h2>
                <p>Banknote printing involves the use of specialized security inks that possess unique properties to deter counterfeiting. These inks often contain color-changing properties, which means they can shift colors when viewed from different angles or under specific lighting conditions. Fluorescent inks, which emit a visible glow under ultraviolet (UV) light, are also utilized to incorporate additional security features.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Security Threads:</h2>
                <p>Banknotes commonly incorporate security threads, which are narrow strips embedded within the paper substrate. In Pakistan, security threads are made using a combination of polyester and metallic materials. These threads can be either visible or embedded, and they may feature various security properties such as color-changing, light-reflecting, or microprinting.</p>

                <h2>Polymer Substrates: </h2>
                <p>Alongside traditional paper banknotes, Pakistan has introduced polymer banknotes for certain denominations. Polymer banknotes are made from a durable and flexible polymer substrate, typically a type of polymer film. These banknotes offer enhanced resistance to tearing, water damage, and general wear and tear. Polymer substrates often include additional security features such as transparent windows, holograms, and tactile elements.</p>

            <li>
                <h2>Watermark Materials: </h2>
                <p>Watermarks are another security feature incorporated into banknotes. They are created by embedding translucent materials, such as fibers or strips, into the banknote paper during the manufacturing process. Watermarks are visible when the banknote is held up to light, and they provide an added layer of security against counterfeiting.</p>
