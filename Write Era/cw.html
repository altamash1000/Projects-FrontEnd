            <h1>WHAT IS CRITICAL WRITING?</h1>
<p>It is common for feedback on student writing to focus on the need to engage more critically with the source material. Typical comments from tutors are: ‘too descriptive’, or ‘not enough critical analysis’. This Study Guide gives ideas for how to improve the level of critical analysis you demonstrate in your writing. Other Study Guides you may find useful are: What is Critical Reading?; Using Paragraphs; and The Art of Editing.</p>
<ul>
The most characteristic features of critical writing are:

<li>a clear and confident refusal to accept the conclusions of other writers without evaluating the arguments and evidence that they provide;</li>
<li>a balanced presentation of reasons why the conclusions of other writers may be accepted or may need to be treated with caution;</li>
    <li>a clear presentation of your own evidence and argument, leading to your conclusion; and</li>
        <li>a recognition of the limitations in your own evidence, argument, and conclusion.</li>
</ul>
            <h1>What is descriptive writing?</h1>
<p>The most characteristic features of descriptive writing are that it will describe something, but will not go beyond an account of what appears to be there. A certain amount of descriptive writing is needed to establish for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the setting of the research;</li>
        <li>a general description of a piece of literature, or art;</li>
            <li>the list of measurements taken;</li>
                <li>the timing of the research;</li>
                    <li>an account of the biographical details of a key figure in the discipline; or</li>
                        <li>a brief summary of the history leading up to an event or decision.</li>
                            <li>The difference between descriptive writing and critical writing</li>
                                <li>With descriptive writing you are not developing argument; </li>
</ul>
<p>you are merely setting the background within which an argument can be developed. You are representing the situation as it stands, without presenting any analysis or discussion.

Descriptive writing is relatively simple. There is also the trap that it can be easy to use many, many words from your word limit, simply providing description.

In providing only description, you are presenting but not transforming information; you are reporting ideas but not taking them forward in any way. An assignment using only descriptive writing would therefore gain few marks.

With critical writing you are participating in the academic debate. This is more challenging and risky. You need to weigh up the evidence and arguments of others, and to contribute your own. You will need to:<p>
<ul>
    <li>consider the quality of the evidence and argument you have read;</li>
        <li>identify key positive and negative aspects you can comment upon;</li>
            <li>assess their relevance and usefulness to the debate that you are engaging in for your assignment; and</li>
                <li>identify how best they can be woven into the argument that you are developing.</li>
                    <li>A much higher level of skill is clearly needed for critical writing than for descriptive writing, and this is reflected in the higher marks it is given.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Finding your academic voice</h1>
<p>When you engage in critical writing you are developing your own academic voice within your subject. Wellington et al. (2005 p.84) offer some suggestions for distinguishing between the academic and the non-academic voice. They suggest that the academic voice will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>“healthy scepticism … but not cynicism;</li>
<li>confidence … but not ‘cockiness’ or arrogance;</li>
<li>judgement which is critical … but not dismissive;</li>
    <li>opinions … without being opinionated;</li>
        <li>careful evaluation of published work … not serial shooting at random targets;</li>
        <li>being ‘fair’: assessing fairly the strengths and weaknesses of other people’s ideas and writing … without prejudice; and</li>
making judgements on the basis of considerable thought and all the available evidence … as opposed to assertions without reason.”

</ul>
<p>Try to get into the habit of writing critically, by making sure that you read critically, and that you include critique in your writing.</p>

<h1>Stringing together of quotes</h1>
<p>It can be tempting to string together quotes to support an argument, feeling that the more quotes you include, the stronger your argument. It is important, however, to remember that you also need to interpret the quotes to the reader, and to explain their relevance, discuss their validity, and show how they relate to other evidence.</p>

<h1>Strategic use of paragraphs</h1>
<p>There are several ways in which you can use the paragraph to enhance your critical writing.</p>
