            <h1 class="apaheading">APA:</h1>
            <article class="para-apaheading">A citation is a quotation or an explicit reference to a source of information. When writing a paper of any kind, it is vital that you cite your sources accurately.

                The APA is the American Psychological Association. Over time, they have developed a generally accepted style of writing papers and citing sources used throughout the scientific and social scientific worlds.An APA Citation is a citation written in this style.There are many manuals that detail how to use the APA Citation style. I have used one of these in researching this article. It is titled A Writer’s Reference by Diana Hacker and Nancy Sommers. If I were to cite that book using the APA Citation method, it would look like this:

                Hacker, D., & Sommers, N. (2011). A Writer’s Reference (7th ed.). Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin’s.

        <div class="mla">
            <h1 class="mlaheading">MLA:</h1>
            <article class="para-mlaheading">MLA Citation Style refers to a set of rules and conventions established by the Modern Language Association for crediting sources used in a research paper usually in the fields of social studies and liberal arts.

                MLA Citations are done by using what is known as parenthetical citation. In this method, relevant source information is placed in parentheses after a certain quote or paraphrase. The required source information in parenthetical citations depends upon two things: upon the source medium and upon the source’s entry on the Works Cited page.
                
                MLA Citations use a two-part parenthetical documentation system for citing reference works: In-Text Citations and the Works Cited List. In-Text Citations are used to point to an alphabetical Works Cited list which appears at the end of your paper. Together, they credit all the sources used in your paper and at the same time help all your readers access and retrieve any of these cited source materials.
                
                For familiar historical documents, such as the United States Constitution, corresponding entry in the Works Cited list is no longer needed.
                
                Common knowledge, familiar proverbs and well-known quotations no longer need to be cited. Just be reminded that citing sources is a choice based on readers. If you’re writing for experts, like scholarly journals, they may have different expectations of what constitutes common knowledge.<br><br><br><br>

        <div class="howard">
            <h1 class="howardheading">Howard:</h1>
            <article class="para-howardheading">The Harvard style or Harvard referencing is an author-year system that is widely used in academia. The use of Harvard referencing means putting the source citation right after the quote, thus referring directly to the reference list.

                This is also called parenthetic referencing, and only short forms are used since the citation is embedded in the actual text (Author Year: Page number). Harvard referencing is completely devoid of footnotes and is widely used because it is straightforward, simple, and economical.f you are about to write an academic paper, you will have to decide which citation system to use. In essence, it is matter of choosing between putting your source citations in footnotes or placing them in short references right after the quote.

                The latter is an author-year system, which is also called the Harvard style or Harvard referencing. Quite often, the faculty and/or your supervisor will specifiy which system you should follow.
                
                In some fields of study, it is common to stick to one particular system like Harvard referencing, but in other fields it may not be that clear. One has to bear in mind though, that all citation systems, like Harvard referencing or the APA citation style, have the same purpose: that always making it clear which parts of the text are quoting someone else’s ideas.
                
                Bear in mind: The short reference in parentheses is part of the actual sentence and must be put before a period when using Harvard referencing.Harvard referencing, also called the Harvard style, is an author-year system that is widely used in academia for referencing. It requires putting the citation right after a sourced quote, thus referring directly to the reference list. It is one of several referencing and citation styles used for academic writing.

            <h1 class="chicagoheading">Chicago:</h1>
            <article class="para-chicagoheading">The Chicago style citation is extremely flexible as it unites the two main referencing styles (footnotes or author-year system) in one manual of style.

                When writing longer academic texts, the use of footnotes for referencing is preferred since author-year systems are usually without footnotes. However, the Chicago style citation proposes an additional possibility that renders this system even more flexible: except with additional comments/remarks are added to the economical author-year system.Choosing a citation style is part of the process of writing your bachelor’s thesis or master’s thesis. You have to decide between putting your source citations into footnotes (notes-bibliography style) or in parentheses right after the quote (author-date system). The Chicago style citation system allows for both.

                In essence, all systems have the same purpose: to guarantee that it is always clear to the reader which parts of your texts are quotations and which are your own interpretations/ideas.The Chicago style, also called the Turabian style, of citation is an extremely flexible citation style. It unites the two main referencing styles (footnotes and author-year system) in one manual style of citation. This entails using footnotes or endnotes to reference pieces of work in the research paper or essay. In addition, a superscript number is placed after a quote or a paraphrase used to cite from a source.
